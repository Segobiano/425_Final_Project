MAZE TOWER DEFENSE
by Brad Segobiano and Brandon Shea

Summary:
It is a tower defense style game. Utilize your towers to not only shoot ogres, but also create a maze they must traverse in order to reach the waypoints. Kill ogres, earn cash, and build your ultimate maze!

Build Mode Controls:
selecte a node with a mouse click
Press 'B' to build a tower on the selected node
Press 'U' to upgrade tower if selected node has a tower
Press the GUI creep button to begin creep phase

Creep Mode Controls:
Use mouse to move camera by moving the cursor to the edges of the screen
Click the mouse the plane to place a Slowing trap. NOTE! this can only be used once per round.

Division of duties:
We both pretty much had a hand in everything. Original design and idea is from Brad.
Major contributions:
	Mouse Controls 	: Brandon
	Game State arch	: Brandon
	Towers/shooting	: Brandon
	Grid and Level	: Brad
	Mouse clicking	: Brad
	traps		: Brad
	AND MORE!
That is just from the top of my head...again, we both pretty much had input on every aspect of the game. There was a lot of communication and collaboration in the design.

TODO:
 Implement Robot mesh instead of Sinbad mesh for agents
 More player interaction during creep phase
 Animations! We would love more animations in the game, such as constructing the towers and better shooting animations.
 drawing the path of the agents during the build phase so you can see what it is and how it changes based on where you place your towers.
 Different types of towers.
 Balance, balance, balance.

Bugs:
 Just found one before turning in. There may be a single tile that is considered occuppied but does not have anything on it. I have not been able to replicate this yet.

Notes:
Included are the material, mesh, sound, and other files need to run the game. Please move them to their respecive directories in the OGRE3d framework.
Start menu values determine the difficulty of the game pretty much. If you have more walls, than there is less space for you to place towers, but more natural choke points. Think about how each setting will impact your play through.
